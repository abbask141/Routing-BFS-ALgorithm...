# Routing Algorithm

This projevct is based on an routing Algorithms
and in this Project we have implemented BFS for our project.

## Features
This programm have following Features:
- can select starting node.
- Ending node.
- can add edge.
- give the shortest distance by highlited color.
- can add the node.
- remove the node


## Requirements
To run this programm you should have some softwares on your system like :
- java fxsdk (to add this in project librarires.)
- jdk.
- intellij (optionally you can use other platforms of java also.)


## Procedure to run
- first of all add the librarires by going into project structure and then to librarires (java FXSDK).
- After setting the librarires now we have to edit the run configurations because we have used java FXSDK and it can't be run without edit the run configurations so after going to run configurations add new configurations and then give any name you want and then select the Main class and then select modify options and select VM options and in the VM options add the code like (--module-path "C:\Users\Khaliq Lala\Downloads\Compressed\javafx-sdk-17.0.15\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ) this contain the paths of library and the jdk after setting the VM option apply it and then clik on ok and then you can easily Run it.
- thanks
